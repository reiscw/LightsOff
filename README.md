# LightsOff
A Java-based implementation of the classic Lights Off puzzle.

This is a fairly simple (two classes) implementation of the classic Lights Off puzzle.  It should be accessible (easy enough to follow) for most students completing an AP Computer Science A course - the graphical user interface elements have been kept as simple as possible.

Note that I believe that all puzzles are solvable based on research that I did (a link to that source is in the source code).  The particular method of generating puzzles often leads to fairly simple initial puzzles (a small number of lights which are on) but they often require multiple iterations of the standard solving method.
